# Advent of Code 2021 (Rust)
My answers to the 2021 Advent of Code. I did this somewhere during februari 2022, to get acquinted with Rust. 

I didn't put any effort in the framework, but just tried to solve the excercises. This is my first advent of code, and I'm not an experienced Ruster either. So let's see how it will go :)
